# Electric car calculations

Just a quick repository to do some calculations on electric car ownership versus votes for (ev critical) coalition parties and other factors.

This was a trial to see whether there was a discrepancy between electric car ownership and voting behavior, similar to the attitude towards renewable energy in the American South. Turns out there is none, also see the plots in the `plots/` folder.
